THE DISTRIBUTION ON PERMUTATIONS INDUCED BY
A RANDOM PARKING FUNCTION
ROSS G. PINSKY
Abstract. A parking function on [n] creates a permutation in Sn via
the order in which the n cars appear in the n parking spaces. Placing the uniform probability measure on the set of parking functions on
[n] induces a probability measure on Sn. We initiate a study of some
properties of this distribution.
1. Introduction and Statement of Results
Consider a row of n parking spaces on a one-way street. A line of n
cars, numbered from 1 to n, attempts to park, one at a time. The ith car’s
preferred space is spot number πi ∈ [n]. If this space is already taken, then
car i proceeds forward and parks in the first available space, if one exists.
If the car is unable to park, it exits the street. A sequence π = {πi}
n
i=1
is called a parking function on [n] if all n cars are able to park. It is easy
to see that π is a parking function if and only if |{i : πi ≤ j}| ≥ j, for all
j ∈ [n]. Let Pn denote the set of parking functions. It is well-known that
|Pn| = (n+ 1)n−1
. There are a number of proofs of this result; a particularly
elegant one due to Pollack can be found in [3]. There is a large literature on
parking functions and their generalizations; see, for example, the survey [5].
