\begin{abstract}
A parking function on $[n]$ creates a permutation in $S_n$ via the order in which the $n$ cars appear in the $n$ parking spaces.
Placing the uniform probability measure on the set of parking functions on $[n]$ induces a probability measure on $S_n$. We initiate a study of some properties of this distribution.
Let $P_n^{\text{park}}$ denote this distribution on $S_n$ and let $P_n$ denote the uniform distribution on $S_n$. In particular, we obtain an explicit formula for
$P_n^{\text{park}}(\sigma)$ for all $\sigma\in S_n$. Then we show that for all but an asymptotically $P_n$-negligible set of permutations, one has
$P_n^{\text{park}}(\sigma)\in\left(\frac{(2-\epsilon)^n}{(n+1)^{n-1}},\frac{(2+\epsilon)^n}{(n+1)^{n-1}}\right)$.
However, this accounts for only an exponentially small part of the $P_n^{\text{park}}$-probability.  We also obtain an explicit formula for
$P_n^{\text{park}}(\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+1}=i_1,\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+2}=i_2,\cdots, \sigma^{-1}_n=i_j)$, the probability that the last $j$ cars park in positions
$i_1,\cdots, i_j$ respectively, and  show that
the  $j$-dimensional random vector $(n+1-\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+l}, n+1-\sigma^{-1}_{n-j+2},\cdots, n+1-\sigma^{-1}_{n})$
under $P_n^{\text{park}}$ converges in distribution to a random vector
$(\sum_{r=1}^jX_r,\sum_{r=2}^j X_r,\cdots, X_{j-1}+X_j,X_j)$, where $\{X_r\}_{r=1}^j$ are IID with the Borel distribution.
We then show that in fact for $j_n=o(n^\frac16)$, the final $j_n$ cars will park in increasing order with probability approaching 1 as $n\to\infty$.

\section{Introduction and Statement of Results}\label{intro}
\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.3}
Consider a row of  $n$ parking spaces on a one-way street. A line of $n$ cars, numbered from 1 to $n$, attempt to park, one at a time. The $i$th car's preferred space is spot number $\pi_i\in[n]$.
If this space is already taken, then car $i$ proceeds forward and parks in the first available space, if one exists. If the  car is unable to park, it exits the street.
A sequence $\pi=\{\pi_i\}_{i=1}^n$ is called a parking function on $[n]$ if all $n$ cars are able to park. It is easy to see that $\pi$ is a parking function if and only if
$|\{i:\pi_i\le j\}|\ge j$, for all $j\in[n]$.  Let $\mathcal{P}_n$ denote the set of parking functions. It is well-known that
$|\mathcal{P}_n|=(n+1)^{n-1}$. There are a number of proofs of this result; a particularly  elegant one due to Pollack can be found in
\cite{FR}.
There is a large literature on parking functions and their generalizations; see, for example, the survey \cite{Y}.
