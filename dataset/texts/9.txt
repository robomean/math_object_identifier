ARITHMETIC PROPERTIES OF AN ANALOGUE OF t-CORE
PARTITIONS
PRANJAL TALUKDAR
Abstract. An integer partition of a positive integer n is called to be t-core if none of
its hook lengths are divisible by t. Recently, Gireesh, Ray and Shivashankar [â€˜A new
analogue of t-core partitionsâ€™, Acta Arith. 199 (2021), 33-53] introduced an analogue
at(n) of the t-core partition function ct(n). They obtained certain multiplicative
formulas and arithmetic identities for at(n) where t âˆˆ {3, 4, 5, 8} and studied the
arithmetic density of at(n) modulo p
j
i where t = p

Very recently, Bandyopadhyay and Baruah [â€˜Arithmetic identities for some analogs
of the 5-core partition functionâ€™, J. Integer Seq. 27 (2024), # 24.4.5] proved new
arithmetic identities satisfied by a5(n). In this article, we study the arithmetic densities of at(n) modulo arbitrary powers of 2 and 3 for t = 3Î±m where gcd(m, 6)=1.
Also, employing a result of Ono and Taguchi on the nilpotency of Hecke operators,
we prove an infinite family of congruences for a3(n) modulo arbitrary powers of 2.
Key words: t-core partition, analogue of t-core partition, theta functions, modular forms, arithmetic

1. Introduction and statement of results
A partition Ï€ = {Ï€1, Ï€2, Â· Â· Â· , Ï€k} of a positive integer n is a non-increasing sequence
of natural numbers such that X
k
i=1
Ï€i = n. The number of partitions of n is denoted by
p(n). The Ferrersâ€“Young diagram of Ï€ is an array of nodes with Ï€i nodes in the ith
row. The (i, j) hook is the set of nodes directly to the right of (i, j) node, together with
the set of nodes directly below it, as well as the (i, j) node itself. The hook number,
H(i, j), is the total number of nodes on the (i, j) hook. For a positive integer t â‰¥ 2, a
partition of n is said to be t-core if none of the hook numbers are divisible by t. We
illustrate the Ferrers-Young diagram of the partition 4 + 3 + 1 of 8 with hook numbers
as follows:
â€¢

4 â€¢

It is clear that for t â‰¥ 7, the partition 4 + 3 + 1 of 8 is a t-core partition.

Suppose that ct(n) counts the t-core partitions of n, then the generating function of
ct(n) is given by (see [6, Eq 2.1])
Xâˆž
n=0
ct(n)q
n =
(q
t
; q
t
)
t

(q; q)âˆž

, (1.1)
where here and throughout the paper, for |q| < 1, we define (a; q)âˆž := Yâˆž
k=0
(1 âˆ’ aqk
)
and for convenience, we set fk := (q
k
; q
k
)âˆž for integers k â‰¥ 1.
In an existence result, Granville and Ono [9] proved that if t â‰¥ 4, then ct(n) > 0 for
every nonnegative integer n. A brief survey of t-core partitions can be found in [5].
Again, for an integral power series F(q) := Xâˆž
n=0
a(n)q
n
and 0 â‰¤ r < M, we define the
arithmetic density Î´r(F, M; X) as
Î´r(F, M; X) := # {0 â‰¤ n â‰¤ X : a(n) â‰¡ r (mod M)}
X
.
An integral power series F is called lacunary modulo M if
lim
Xâ†’âˆž
Î´0(F, M; X) = 1,
that is, almost all of the coefficients of F are divisible by M.
Arithmetic densities of ct(n) modulo arbitrary powers of 2, 3 and primes greater
than or equal to 5 are recently studied by Jindal and Meher [11].
Recall that for |ab| < 1, Ramanujanâ€™s general theta function f(a, b) is given by
f(a, b) = Xâˆž
n=âˆ’âˆž
a
n(n+1)/2
b
n(nâˆ’1)/2
.
In Ramanujanâ€™s notation, the Jacobi triple product identity [3, p. 35, Entry 19] takes
the shape
f(a, b) = (âˆ’a; ab)âˆž(âˆ’b; ab)âˆž(ab; ab)âˆž.
Consider the following two special cases of f(a, b):
Ï•(âˆ’q) := f(âˆ’q, âˆ’q) = Xâˆž
n=âˆ’âˆž
(âˆ’1)n
q

) = Xâˆž
n=âˆ’âˆž
(âˆ’1)n
q
n(3nâˆ’1)/2 = f1. (1.3)
In the notation of Ramanujanâ€™s theta functions, the generating function of ct(n) may
be rewritten as
Xâˆž
n=0
ct(n)q
n =
f
t
(âˆ’q
t
)
f(âˆ’q)
. (1.4)
ARITHMETIC PROPERTIES OF AN ANALOGUE OF t-CORE PARTITIONS 3
Recently, Gireesh, Ray and Shivashankar [7] considered a new function at(n) by
substituting Ï•(âˆ’q) in place of f(âˆ’q) in the generating function of ct(n) (in (1.4)),
namely
Xâˆž
n=0

They proved several multiplicative formulas and arithmetic identities for at(n) for t =
2, 3, 4 and 8 using Ramanujanâ€™s theta functions and q-series techniques. Using the
theory of modular forms, they studied the divisibility of at(n) modulo arbitrary powers
of primes greater than 5. More precisely, they proved the following theorem.
Theorem 1.1. Let t = p
a1

Â· Â· Â· p

â€™s are prime numbers greater than or equal
to 5. Then for every positive integer j, we have
lim
Xâ†’âˆž

= 1.
They also deduced a Ramanujan type congruence for a5(n) modulo 5 by using an
algorithm developed by Radu and Sellers [15]. Bandyopadhyay and Baruah [2] proved
some new identities connecting a5(n) and c5(n). They also found a reccurence relation
for a5(n).
Recently, Cotron et. al. [4, Theorem 1.1] proved a strong result regarding lacunarity of eta-quotients modulo arbitrary powers of primes under certain conditions. We
observe that the eta-quotients associated with at(n) do not satisfy these conditions,
which makes the problem of studying lacunarity of at(n) more interesting. In this
article, we study the arithmetic densities of at(n) modulo arbitrary powers of 2 and 3
where t = 3Î±m. To be specific, we prove the following theorems.
Theorem 1.2. Let k â‰¥ 1, Î± â‰¥ 0 and m â‰¥ 1 be integers with gcd(m, 6) = 1. Then the
set

n âˆˆ N : a3Î±m(n) â‰¡ 0 (mod 2k
)
	
has arithmetic density 1.
Theorem 1.3. Let k â‰¥ 1, Î± â‰¥ 0 and m â‰¥ 1 be integers with gcd(m, 6) = 1. Then the
set

n âˆˆ N : a3Î±m(n) â‰¡ 0 (mod 3k
)
	
has arithmetic density 1.
The fact that the action of Hecke algebras on spaces of modular forms of level 1
modulo 2 is locally nilpotent was first observed by Serre and proved by Tate (see [16],
[17], [18]). Later, this result was generalized to higher levels by Ono and Taguchi [14].
In this article, we observe that the eta-quotient associated to a3(n) is a modular form
whose level is in the list of Ono and Taguchi. Thus, we use a result of Ono and Taguchi
to prove the following congruences for a3(n).

Theorem 1.4. Let n be a nonnegative integer. Then there exists an integer c â‰¥ 0 such
that for every d â‰¥ 1 and distinct primes p1, . . . , pc+d coprime to 6, we have

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we state some preliminaries of the
theory of modular forms. Then we prove Theorems 1.2-1.4 using the properties of
modular forms in Sections 3-5 respectively. And finally, we mention some directions
for future study in the concluding section.
2. Preliminaries
In this section, we recall some basic facts and definitions on modular forms. For
more details, one can see [12] and [13].
Firstly, we define the matrix groups
SL2(Z) := a b
c d
: a, b, c, d âˆˆ Z, ad âˆ’ bc = 1,
Î“0(N) := a b
c d
âˆˆ SL2(Z) : c â‰¡ 0 (mod N)
,
Î“1(N) := a b
c d
âˆˆ Î“0(N) : a â‰¡ d â‰¡ 1 (mod N)
,
and
Î“(N) := a b
c d
âˆˆ SL2(Z) : a â‰¡ d â‰¡ 1 (mod N), and b â‰¡ c â‰¡ 0 (mod N)
,
where N is a positive integer. A subgroup Î“ of SL2(Z) is called a congruence subgroup
if Î“(N) âŠ† Î“ for some N and the smallest N with this property is called the level of Î“.
For instance, Î“0(N) and Î“1(N) are congruence subgroups of level N.
Let H denote the upper half of the complex plane. The group
GL+
2
(R) := a b
c d
âˆˆ SL2(Z) : a, b, c, d âˆˆ R and ad âˆ’ bc > 0
acts on H by 
a b
c d
z =
az + b
cz + d
. We identify âˆž with 1
0
and define 
a b
c d
r
s
=
ar + bs
cr + ds,
where r
s
âˆˆ Qâˆª {âˆž}. This gives an action of GL+
2
(R) on the extended upper half plane
Hâˆ— = H âˆª Q âˆª {âˆž}. Suppose that Î“ is a congruence subgroup of SL2(Z). A cusp of Î“
is an equivalence class in P
1 = Q âˆª {âˆž} under the action of Î“.
The group GL+
2
(R) also acts on functions f : H â†’ C. In particular, suppose that
Î³ =

a b
c d
âˆˆ GL+
2
(R). If f(z) is a meromorphic function on H and â„“ is an integer,
ARITHMETIC PROPERTIES OF AN ANALOGUE OF t-CORE PARTITIONS 5
then define the slash operator |â„“ by
(f|â„“Î³)(z) := (det(Î³))â„“/2
(cz + d)
âˆ’â„“
f(Î³z).
Definition 2.1. Let Î“ be a congruence subgroup of level N. A holomorphic function
f : H â†’ C is called a modular form with integer weight â„“ on Î“ if the following hold:
(1) We have
f

az + b
cz + d

= (cz + d)
â„“
f(z)
for all z âˆˆ H and and all 
a b
c d
âˆˆ Î“.
(2) If Î³ âˆˆ SL2(Z), then (f|â„“Î³)(z) has a Fourier expansion of the form
(f|â„“Î³)(z) = X
nâ‰¥0
aÎ³(n)q
n
N ,
where q := e
2Ï€iz/N .
For a positive integer â„“, the complex vector space of modular forms of weight â„“ with
respect to a congruence subgroup Î“ is denoted by Mâ„“(Î“).
Definition 2.2. [13, Definition 1.15] If Ï‡ is a Dirichlet character modulo N, then we
say that a modular form f âˆˆ Mâ„“(Î“1(N)) has Nebentypus character Ï‡ if
f

az + b
cz + d

= Ï‡(d)(cz + d)
â„“
f(z)
for all z âˆˆ H and all 
a b
c d
âˆˆ Î“0(N). The space of such modular forms is denoted by
Mâ„“(Î“0(N), Ï‡).
The relevant modular forms for the results of this paper arise from eta-quotients.
Recall that the Dedekind eta-function Î·(z) is defined by
Î·(z) := q
1/24(q; q)âˆž = q
1/24 Yâˆž
n=1
(1 âˆ’ q
n
),
where q := e
2Ï€iz and z âˆˆ H. A function f(z) is called an eta-quotient if it is of the
form
f(z) = Y
Î´|N
Î·(Î´z)
rÎ´
,
where N is a positive integer and rÎ´ is an integer. Now, we recall two important
theorems from [13, p. 18] which will be used later.
6 P. TALUKDAR
Theorem 2.1. [13, Theorem 1.64] If f(z) = Y
Î´|N
Î·(Î´z)
rÎ´
is an eta-quotient such that
â„“ =

X
Î´|N
Î´rÎ´ â‰¡ 0 (mod 24) and X
Î´|N

Î´
rÎ´ â‰¡ 0 (mod 24),
then f(z) satisfies
f

az + b
cz + d

= Ï‡(d)(cz + d)
â„“
f(z)
for every 
a b
c d
âˆˆ Î“0(N). Here the character Ï‡ is defined by Ï‡(d) := 
(âˆ’1)â„“
s
d

,
where s := Y
Î´|N
Î´
rÎ´
.
Consider f to be an eta-quotient which satisfies the conditions of Theorem 2.1 and
that the associated weight â„“ is a positive integer. If f(z) is holomorphic at all the cusps
of Î“0(N), then f(z) âˆˆ Mâ„“ (Î“0(N), Ï‡). The necessary criterion for determining orders
of an eta-quotient at cusps is given by the following theorem.
Theorem 2.2. [13, Theorem 1.64] Let c, d and N be positive integers with d|N and
gcd(c, d)=1. If f is an eta-quotient satisfying the conditions of Theorem 2.1 for N,
then the order of vanishing of f(z) at the cusp (c/d) is
N
24
X
Î´|N
gcd(d, Î´)
2
rÎ´
gcd(d, N/d)dÎ´ .
We now recall a deep theorem of Serre [13, Page 43] which will be used in proving
Theorems 1.2 and 1.3.
Theorem 2.3. [13, p. 43] Let g(z) âˆˆ Mk(Î“0(N), Ï‡) has Fourier expansion
g(z) = Xâˆž
n=0
b(n)q
n âˆˆ Z[[q]].
Then for a positive integer r, there is a constant Î± > 0 such that
#{0 < n â‰¤ X : b(n) 6â‰¡ 0 (mod r)} = O

X
(logX)
Î±

.
Equivalently
lim
Xâ†’âˆž
#{0 < n â‰¤ X : b(n) 6â‰¡ 0 (mod r)}
X
= 0.

Finally, we recall the definition of Hecke operators. Let m be a positive integer and
f(z) = Xâˆž
n=0
a(n)q
n âˆˆ Mâ„“(Î“0(N), Ï‡). Then the action of Hecke operator Tm on f(z) is
defined by

We note that a(n) = 0 unless n is a nonnegative integer.

Next, we will show that BÎ±,m,k(z) is a modular form. Applying Theorem 2.1, we find
that the level of BÎ±,m,k(z) is N = 243
Î±+1mM, where M is the smallest positive integer
such that

Therefore M = 4 and the level of BÎ±,m,k(z) is N = 263
Î±+1m.
The representatives for the cusps of Î“0 (263
Î±+1m) are given by fractions c/d where
d|2
63
Î±+1m and gcd(c, 2
63
Î±+1m) = 1 (see [4, Proposition 2.1]). By Theorem 2.2,
BÎ±,m,k(z) is holomorphic at a cusp c/d if and only if

Equivalently, BÎ±,m,k(z) is holomorphic at a cusp c/d if and only if

(4G3 âˆ’ 1) â‰¥ 0,

Let d be a divisor of 263
Î±+1m. We can write d = 2r1 3
r2
t where 0 â‰¤ r1 â‰¤ 6,
0 â‰¤ r2 â‰¤ Î± + 1 and t|m. We now consider the following two cases depending on r1.
Case 1: Let 0 â‰¤ r1 â‰¤ 3, 0 â‰¤ r2 â‰¤ Î±+ 1. Then G1 = G2,

Therefore L = 3Î±+1m(1 âˆ’ G1) + 3 Â· 2

Case 2: Let 4 â‰¤ r1 â‰¤ 6, 0 â‰¤ r2 â‰¤ Î± + 1. Then G2 = 4G1,

Hence, BÎ±,m,k(z) is holomorphic at every cusp c/d. The weight of BÎ±,m,k(z) is â„“ =

Thus, BÎ±,m,k(z) âˆˆ Mâ„“ (Î“0(N), Ï‡) where â„“, N and Ï‡ are as above. Therefore by
Theorem 2.3, the Fourier coefficients of BÎ±,m,k(z) are almost divisible by r = 2k
. Due
to (3.3), this holds for a3Î±m(n) also. This completes the proof of Theorem 1.

Therefore M = 1 and the level of DÎ±,m,k(z) is N = 243

Let d be a divisor of 243

and t|m. We now consider the following four cases depending on the values of r1 and

Therefore DÎ±,m,k(z) is holomorphic at every cusp c/d. The weight of DÎ±,m,k(z) is
â„“ =

Thus, DÎ±,m,k(z) âˆˆ Mâ„“ (Î“0(N), Ï‡) where â„“, N and Ï‡ are as above. Therefore by
Theorem 2.3, the Fourier coefficients of DÎ±,m,k(z) are almost divisible by r = 3k
. Due
to (4.2), this holds for a3Î±m(n) also. This completes the proof of Theorem 1.3.
5. Proof of Theorem 1.4
First we recall the following result of Ono and Taguchi [14] on the nilpotency of
Hecke operators.
Theorem 5.1. [14, Theorem 1.3 (3)] Let n be a nonnegative integer and k be a positive
integer. Let Ï‡ be a quadratic Dirichlet character of conductor 9 Â· 2
a
. Then there is an
integer c â‰¥ 0 such that for every f(z) âˆˆ Mk(Î“0(9 Â· 2
a
), Ï‡) âˆ© Z[[q]] and every t â‰¥ 1,
f(z)|Tp1
|Tp2
| Â· Â· Â· |Tpc+t â‰¡ 0 (mod 2t
)
whenever the primes p1, . . . , pc+t are coprime to 6.
Now, we apply the above theorem to the modular form B1,1,k(z) to prove Theorem
1.4.
ARITHMETIC PROPERTIES OF AN ANALOGUE OF t-CORE PARTITIONS 11
Putting Î± = 1 and m = 1 in (3.3), we find that
B1,1,k(z) â‰¡

(mod 2k+1),

(mod 2k+1). (5.1)
Now, B1,1,k(z) âˆˆ M2
kâˆ’1+1 (Î“0(9 Â· 2
6
), Ï‡3) for k â‰¥ 1 where Ï‡3 is the associated character (which is Ï‡1 evaluated at Î± = 1 and m = 1). In view of Theorem 5.1, we find that
there is an integer c â‰¥ 0 such that for any d â‰¥ 1,
B1,1,k(z) | Tp1
| Tp2
| Â· Â· Â· | Tpc+d â‰¡ 0 (mod 2d
)
whenever p1, . . . , pc+d are coprime to 6. It follows from the definition of Hecke operators
that if p1, . . . , pc+d are distinct primes and if n is coprime to p1 Â· Â· Â· pc+d, then
Fk (p1 Â· Â· Â· pc+d Â· n) â‰¡ 0 (mod 2d
). (5.2)
Combining (5.1) and (5.2), we complete the proof of the theorem.
6. Concluding Remarks
(1) Theorems 1.2 and 1.3 of this paper and Theorem 1.8 of [7] give us the arithmetic
densities of at(n) for odd t and similar techniques can not be used to obtain the
arithmetic density of at(n) when t is even. It would be interesting to study the
arithmetic density of at(n) for even values of t.
(2) Computational evidence suggests that there are Ramanujan type congruences
for at(n) modulo powers of 2, 3 and other primes â‰¥ 5 for various t which are
not covered by the results of [2] and [7]. We encourage the readers to find new
congruences for at(n).
(3) Asymptotic formulas for partition functions and other related functions have
been widely studied in the literature. For instance, the asymptotic formulas for
p(n) and ct(n) were obtained by Hardy and Ramanujan [10] and Anderson [1]
respectively. It will be desirable to find an asymptotic formula for at(n).
(4) Some relations connecting at(n) and ct(n) have been discussed in [2]. A combinatorial treatment to at(n) might reveal more interesting partition theoretic
connections of at(n).
