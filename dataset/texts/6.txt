Abstract
In this short note, we prove the existence of a finitely presented group with
transcendental spectral radius. The proof relies on links between decidability of
the Word Problem and semi-computability of the spectral radius.
Throughout the paper, we consider marked groups, that is, pairs (G, S) with G a finitely
generated group and S a finite symmetric generating set (i.e., S = S
−1
). We define the
cogrowth sequence1 and the spectral radius of (G, S) as
c(n) = #{w ∈ S
∗
: ℓ(w) = n and ¯w = eG},
ρ(G, S) = lim sup
n→∞
1
|S|
pn
c(n).
Our main result is the following:
Theorem 1. There exists a finitely presented group G such that, for all finite symmetric
generating sets S, the spectral radius ρ(G, S) is transcendental.
This answers a question of Kassabov and Pak [KP24, Question 7.2]. Our proof uses
crucially that G has undecidable Word Problem. (In particular, balls in its Cayley graph
are not “explicit” in the sense of [HLW06, §2.1].) We propose the refined question:
Question. Does there exist a finitely presented (or recursively presented) group (G, S)
with decidable Word Problem and transcendental spectral radius ρ(G, S)?
Of course, we still expect a positive answer, starting with G = π1(Σ2) a surface group.
