\begin{abstract}
	In this short note, we prove the existence of a finitely presented group with transcendental spectral radius. The proof relies on links between decidability of the Word Problem and semi-computability of the spectral radius.
\end{abstract}

Throughout the paper, we consider \emph{marked groups}, that is, pairs $(G,S)$ with $G$ a finitely generated group and $S$ a finite symmetric generating set (i.e., $S=S^{-1}$). We define the \emph{cogrowth sequence}\footnote{The \say{cogrowth sequence} usually refers to $c_n=\#\{w\in F_S\mid \ell(w)=n,\,\bar w=e_G\}$ where $\bar\cdot\colon F_S\onto G$} and the \emph{spectral radius} of $(G,S)$ as
\[ c(n) = \# \{ w\in S^* : \ell(w)=n \text{ and } \bar w=e_G\}, \]
\[ \rho(G,S) = \limsup_{n\to\infty} \frac1{\abs S}\sqrt[n]{c(n)}. \vspace*{-2mm}\]

Our main result is the following:
\begin{thm}
	There exists a finitely presented group $G$ such that, for all finite symmetric generating sets $S$, the spectral radius $\rho(G,S)$ is transcendental.
\end{thm}
This answers a question of Kassabov and Pak \cite[Question 7.2]{kassabov2024monotone}. Our proof uses crucially that $G$ has undecidable Word Problem. (In particular, balls in its Cayley graph are not \say{explicit} in the sense of \cite[\S 2.1]{Linial_Wigderson}.) We propose the refined question:

\textbf{Question.} Does there exist a finitely presented (or recursively presented) group $(G,S)$ with decidable Word Problem and transcendental spectral radius $\rho(G,S)$?

Of course, we still expect a positive answer, starting with $G=\pi_1(\Sigma_2)$ a surface group. \vspace*{-1mm}
%For instance, Sarnak asked the question of the transcendence of the spectral radius for $G=\pi_1(\Sigma_2)$ a surface group. 
%\footnote{Kontsevitch suggests that, in order to prove that a real number is transcendental, it should be constructed in that purpose (eg.\ Liouville numbers), or it should be a \emph{period} (i.e., the integral of an algebraic function over an algebraic domain). No such formula is known for $\rho(\pi_1(\Sigma_2))$.}

\section{Semi-computable numbers}

The first ingredient in our proof is the following definition:
\begin{defi}
	A number $x\in\R$ is \emph{lower semi-computable} (resp.\ \emph{upper semi-computable}) if there exists an algorithm enumerating an increasing (resp.\ decreasing)  sequence $(x_k)$ of real algebraic numbers\footnote{Real algebraic numbers $x_k$ can be specified as triplets $(P_k(X),a_k,b_k)\in\Q[X]\times\Q\times\Q$ such that $x_k$ is the only root of $P_k(X)$ in the interval $[a_k,b_k]$.} such that $x_k\to x$. \vspace*{2mm}
	%We say $x$ is \emph{computable} if it is both lower and upper semi-computable.
\end{defi}
%An algebraic numbers $r$ can be described as 
%By definition, real algebraic numbers are both lower and upper semi-computable. \vspace*{1mm}

\begin{lemma}
	Let $G$ be a recursively presented group, then $\rho(G,S)$ is lower semi-computable. Moreover, the result is effective: there exists an algorithm with specifications
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=18mm, rightmargin=2mm]
		\item[{\normalfont Input:}\hspace*{3mm}] A recursively presented marked group $(G,S)$, specified via a finite set $S$ and an algorithm enumerating a set of defining relations.
		\item[{\normalfont Output:}] An algorithm enumerating an increasing sequence of real algebraic numbers $(x_k)$ such that $x_k\to \rho(G,S)$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Note that $c(m+n)\ge c(m)\cdot c(n)$, therefore Fekete's lemma ensures that
	\[ \rho(G,S) =  \sup_{n\ge 1} \frac1{\abs S}\sqrt[n]{c(n)}. \]
	As $G$ is recursively presented, its Word Problem (i.e., the set of words $w\in S^*$ such that $\bar w=e_G$) is recursively enumerable. Let $(v_i)_{i\ge 1}\subseteq S^*$ be a computable enumeration of the Word Problem, and let us define the \say{partial cogrowth sequence}
	\[ c_k(n) = \#\{v_i : \ell(v_i)=n \text{ and } 1\le i\le k\}. \]
	Observe that $c_k(n)\nearrow c(n)$ pointwise  as $k\to\infty$. In particular
	\[ x_k = \max_{1\le n\le k}\frac1{\abs S}\sqrt[n]{c_k(n)}\]
	is a computable increasing sequence such that $x_k\to \rho(G,S)$, as promised.
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}
	The analogous result for \say{upper semi-computable} doesn't hold, even under the additional assumption that the Word Problem is decidable (with a Word Problem algorithm as part of the input). Indeed, this would imply that amenability is a co-semi-decidable property, contradicting \cite[Theorem 10.6]{Rauzy}.
	
	As will become clear in the proof of Theorem 1, there exists finitely presented groups (with undecidable Word Problem) whose spectral radius is not upper semi-computable.
\end{rem}

\section{From computable spectral radius to decidable Word Problem}

Our main observation is the following:
\begin{thm}\label{thm:comp_to_deci}
	Let $(G,S)$ be a recursively presented group such that the spectral radius $\rho(G,S)$ is upper semi-computable.
	Consider a subset $W\subseteq S^*$ such that, for each $w\in W$, either $\bar w=e_G$ or the normal subgroup generated $\lla \bar w\rra_G$ is non-amenable. Then there exists an algorithm which, given a word $w\in W$, decides whether $\bar w=e_G$ or not.
\end{thm}

(In particular, if $W=S^*$, then $G$ has decidable word problem.) This theorem relies crucially on a classical result due to Kesten.
\begin{thm}[{\cite{Kesten}}]
	Let $(G,S)$ be a marked group and $N\len G$ a non-amenable normal subgroup, then we have $\rho(G,S) < \rho(G/N,S)$.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref*{thm:comp_to_deci}]
	Suppose that $G$ is presented as $\la S\mid R\ra$. Take $w\in W$, we run two parallel processes to decide whether $\bar w=e_G$ or not.
	\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=8mm]
		\item As $G$ is recursively presented, we can enumerate all words $v\in S^*$ such that $\bar v=e_G$. If at any point $v=w$, we stop the algorithm and conclude that $\bar w=e_G$.
		\item The group $G_w=G/\lla \bar w\rra_G=\la S\mid R,w\ra$ is recursively presented, hence $\rho(G_w,S)$ is lower semi-computable. We can compute two sequences $(x_k)$ and $(y_k)$ such that
		\[ x_k\searrow \rho(G,S) \quad\text{and}\quad  y_k\nearrow \rho(G_w,S). \]
		As $x_k$ and $y_k$ are real algebraic, we can compare them. If at any point $x_k<y_k$, we stop the algorithm and conclude that $\bar w\ne e_G$. It should be noted that, if $\bar w\ne e_G$, then the inequality $x_k<y_k$ will hold eventually as $\lla \bar w\rra_G$ is non-amenable and therefore $\rho(G,S)<\rho(G/\!\lla \bar w\rra_G,S)=\rho(G_w,S)$.
	\end{itemize}
	In both cases, the algorithm finishes and decides correctly if $\bar w=e_G$ or not.
\end{proof}

\section{Proof of Theorem 1}

We propose two different constructions, relying both on Theorem \ref*{thm:comp_to_deci}.

\textbf{1.} We recall a family of groups introduced by Higman \cite{Higman}: for each $I\subseteq \Z$,
	\[ H_I \coloneqq \la a,b,c,d \mid a^iba^{-i}=c^idc^{-i} \;\;(i\in I)\ra. \]
This is an amalgamated free product $A*_CB$ with $A=F(a,b)$, $B=F(c,d)$ and $C=F(\{g_i\}_{i\in I})$ (with injections $g_i\mapsto a^ib a^{-i}$ and $g_i\mapsto c^idc^{-i}$ respectively). We define
\[ w_i=a^iba^{-i}c^id^{-1}c^{-i}. \vspace*{-2mm}\]
\begin{lemma}
	If $i\notin I$, then $\lla \bar w_i\rra_{H_I}$ contains a non-abelian free group. \vspace*{-2mm}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	The subgroup $\la w_i,bw_ib^{-1}\ra$ is non-abelian free. This follows directly from the Normal Form Theorem for amalgamated free products, see eg.\ \cite[p. 186-187]{Lyndon_Schupp}.
\end{proof}

Consider $I\subset\Z$ which is recursively enumerable (hence $H_I$ is recursively presented), but not recursive. Using Higman's embedding theorem \cite{Higman}, we can embed $H_I$ into a finitely presented group $G$ (as Higman did). For any finite symmetric generating set $S$ of $G$, we consider a monoid homomorphism $\varphi\colon \{a^\pm,b^\pm,c^\pm,d^\pm\}^*\to S^*$ such that $\overline{\varphi(v)}=\bar v$ for all $v\in\{a^\pm,b^\pm,c^\pm,d^\pm\}$, and let $W=\{\varphi(w_i):i\in\Z\}\subset S^*$.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=8mm]
	\item Using the lemma, either $\bar w_i=e_G$ or $\lla \bar w_i\rra_G\ge \lla \bar w_i\rra_{H_I}$ is non-amenable.
	\item As $I$ is not recursive, there does not exist any algorithm which, given $\varphi(w_i)\in W$ (equivalently $i\in \Z$) decides whether $\bar w_i=e_G$ or not (equivalently $i\in I$ or not).
\end{itemize}
Therefore $\rho(G,S)$ cannot be upper semi-computable, hence cannot be algebraic. \vspace*{2mm} \hfill$\square$

\begin{rem}
	Using Karrass-Solitar theorem on amalgamated free products \cite{Karrass_Solitar}, one should be able to prove that $\lla g\rra_{H_I}$ contains a non-abelian free group for all $g\in H_I\setminus \{e\}$.
\end{rem}

\newpage

\begin{rem} The family $(H_I)_{I\subseteq\Z}$ satisfies the conclusions of Lemma 1.11 of \cite{kassabov2024monotone}. In particular, we recover that the set of values $\{f(H_I,S):I\subseteq \Z\}$ is a continuum for every strictly monotone parameter $f$, simplifying part of the proof of \cite*[Theorem 1.1]{kassabov2024monotone}. That being said, it doesn't allow to reprove their Theorem 1.2 (\say{No isolated point}).
\end{rem}


\bigbreak

\textbf{2.} Consider $H=\la S_0\mid R\ra$ a finitely presented group with unsolvable Word Problem. We consider $G=H*\la t\ra$ with generating set $S=S_0\sqcup\{t^\pm\}$, and $W=S_0^*$.

For all $w\in W$, either $\bar w$ is trivial, or the normal subgroup it generates satisfies
\[ \lla \bar w\rra_G \ge \la \bar w,\, t\bar wt^{-1},\, t^2\bar wt^{-2}\ra \simeq C_n * C_n * C_n \ge F_2 \]
where $n\in\{2,3,\ldots\}\cup\{\infty\}$ is the order of $\bar w$. Again, Theorem \ref*{thm:comp_to_deci} implies that $\rho(G,S)$ cannot be upper semi-computable, hence is transcendental.

In particular, we can take $H$ defined by $10$ generators and $27$ relators \cite{Collins}, and therefore $G$ defined by as little as $11$ generators and $27$ relators. \vspace*{2mm} \hfill$\square$

%\todo{Under which condition are spectral radii upper semi-computable? Is is true for hyperbolic groups? This could be useful to construct an alternate recursively presented example (potentially with solvable word problem) and transcendental spectral radius, via small cancelation theory.}
