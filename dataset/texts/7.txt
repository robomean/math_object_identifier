Abstract
In this short note, we prove the existence of a finitely presented group with
transcendental spectral radius. The proof relies on links between decidability of
the Word Problem and semi-computability of the spectral radius.
Throughout the paper, we consider marked groups, that is, pairs (G, S) with G a finitely
generated group and S a finite symmetric generating set (i.e., S = S
−1
). We define the
cogrowth sequence1 and the spectral radius of (G, S) as
c(n) = #{w ∈ S
∗
: ℓ(w) = n and ¯w = eG},
ρ(G, S) = lim sup
n→∞

|S|
pn
c(n).
Our main result is the following:
Theorem 1. There exists a finitely presented group G such that, for all finite symmetric
generating sets S, the spectral radius ρ(G, S) is transcendental.
This answers a question of Kassabov and Pak [KP24, Question 7.2]. Our proof uses
crucially that G has undecidable Word Problem. (In particular, balls in its Cayley graph
are not “explicit” in the sense of [HLW06, §2.1].) We propose the refined question:
Question. Does there exist a finitely presented (or recursively presented) group (G, S)
with decidable Word Problem and transcendental spectral radius ρ(G, S)?
Of course, we still expect a positive answer, starting with G = π1(Σ2) a surface group.
1. Semi-computable numbers
The first ingredient in our proof is the following definition:
Definition 2. A number x ∈ R is lower semi-computable (resp. upper semi-computable)
if there exists an algorithm enumerating an increasing (resp. decreasing) sequence (xk)
of real algebraic numbers2
such that xk → x.
1The “cogrowth sequence” usually refers to cn = #{w ∈ FS | ℓ(w) = n, w¯ = eG} where ¯·: FS ։ G
2Real algebraic numbers xk can be specified as triplets (Pk(X), ak, bk) ∈ Q[X] × Q × Q such that
xk is the only root of Pk(X) in the interval [ak, bk].

Lemma 3. Let G be a recursively presented group, then ρ(G, S) is lower semi-computable.
Moreover, the result is effective: there exists an algorithm with specifications
Input: A recursively presented marked group (G, S), specified via a finite set S and
an algorithm enumerating a set of defining relations.
Output: An algorithm enumerating an increasing sequence of real algebraic numbers
(xk) such that xk → ρ(G, S).
Proof. Note that c(m + n) > c(m) · c(n), therefore Fekete’s lemma ensures that
ρ(G, S) = sup
n>1

c(n).
As G is recursively presented, its Word Problem (i.e., the set of words w ∈ S
∗
such
that ¯w = eG) is recursively enumerable. Let (vi)i>1 ⊆ S
∗ be a computable enumeration
of the Word Problem, and let us define the “partial cogrowth sequence”
ck(n) = #{vi
: ℓ(vi) = n and 1 6 i 6 k}.
Observe that ck(n) ր c(n) pointwise as k → ∞. In particular
xk = max

|S|

ck(n)
is a computable increasing sequence such that xk → ρ(G, S), as promised.
Remark 4. The analogous result for “upper semi-computable” doesn’t hold, even
under the additional assumption that the Word Problem is decidable (with a Word
Problem algorithm as part of the input). Indeed, this would imply that amenability is
a co-semi-decidable property, contradicting [Rau23, Theorem 10.6].
As will become clear in the proof of Theorem 1, there exists finitely presented groups
(with undecidable Word Problem) whose spectral radius is not upper semi-computable.
2. From computable spectral radius to decidable Word Problem
Our main observation is the following:
Theorem 5. Let (G, S) be a recursively presented group such that the spectral radius
ρ(G, S) is upper semi-computable. Consider a subset W ⊆ S
∗
such that, for each
w ∈ W, either w¯ = eG or the normal subgroup generated hhw¯iiG
is non-amenable. Then
there exists an algorithm which, given a word w ∈ W, decides whether w¯ = eG or not.
(In particular, if W = S
∗
, then G has decidable word problem.) This theorem relies
crucially on a classical result due to Kesten.
Theorem 6 ([Kes59]). Let (G, S) be a marked group and N E G a non-amenable
normal subgroup, then we have ρ(G, S) < ρ(G/N, S).
2
Proof of Theorem 5. Suppose that G is presented as hS | Ri. Take w ∈ W, we run two
parallel processes to decide whether ¯w = eG or not.
• As G is recursively presented, we can enumerate all words v ∈ S
∗
such that ¯v = eG.
If at any point v = w, we stop the algorithm and conclude that ¯w = eG.
• The group Gw = G/ hhw¯iiG = hS | R, wi is recursively presented, hence ρ(Gw, S) is
lower semi-computable. We can compute two sequences (xk) and (yk) such that
xk ց ρ(G, S) and yk ր ρ(Gw, S).
As xk and yk are real algebraic, we can compare them. If at any point xk < yk, we
stop the algorithm and conclude that ¯w 6= eG. It should be noted that, if ¯w 6= eG,
then the inequality xk < yk will hold eventually as hhw¯iiG
is non-amenable and
therefore ρ(G, S) < ρ(G/hhw¯iiG
, S) = ρ(Gw, S).
In both cases, the algorithm finishes and decides correctly if ¯w = eG or not.
3. Proof of Theorem 1
We propose two different constructions, relying both on Theorem 5.
1. We recall a family of groups introduced by Higman [Hig61]: for each I ⊆ Z,
HI
:=


a, b, c, d | a
i
ba−i = c
i
dc−i
(i ∈ I)

.
This is an amalgamated free product A ∗C B with A = F(a, b), B = F(c, d) and
C = F({gi}i∈I ) (with injections gi
7→ a
i
ba−i and gi
7→ c
idc−i
respectively). We define
wi = a
i
ba−i
c
i
d
−1
c
−i
.
Lemma 7. If i /∈ I, then hhw¯iiiHI
contains a non-abelian free group.
Proof. The subgroup hwi
, bwib
−1
i is non-abelian free. This follows directly from the
Normal Form Theorem for amalgamated free products, see eg. [LS77, p. 186-187].
Consider I ⊂ Z which is recursively enumerable (hence HI is recursively presented),
but not recursive. Using Higman’s embedding theorem [Hig61], we can embed HI into
a finitely presented group G (as Higman did). For any finite symmetric generating
set S of G, we consider a monoid homomorphism ϕ: {a
±, b±, c±, d±}
∗ → S
∗
such that
ϕ(v) = ¯v for all v ∈ {a
±, b±, c±, d±}, and let W = {ϕ(wi) : i ∈ Z} ⊂ S
∗
.
• Using the lemma, either ¯wi = eG or hhw¯iiiG > hhw¯iiiHI
is non-amenable.
• As I is not recursive, there does not exist any algorithm which, given ϕ(wi) ∈ W
(equivalently i ∈ Z) decides whether ¯wi = eG or not (equivalently i ∈ I or not).
Therefore ρ(G, S) cannot be upper semi-computable, hence cannot be algebraic.
Remark 8. Using Karrass-Solitar theorem on amalgamated free products [KS70], one
should be able to prove that hhgiiHI
contains a non-abelian free group for all g ∈ HI \{e}.

Remark 9. The family (HI )I⊆Z satisfies the conclusions of Lemma 1.11 of [KP24]. In
particular, we recover that the set of values {f(HI , S) : I ⊆ Z} is a continuum for every
strictly monotone parameter f, simplifying part of the proof of [KP24, Theorem 1.1].
That being said, it doesn’t allow to reprove their Theorem 1.2 (“No isolated point”).
2. Consider H = hS0 | Ri a finitely presented group with unsolvable Word Problem.
We consider G = H ∗ hti with generating set S = S0 ⊔ {t
±}, and W = S
∗
0
.
For all w ∈ W, either ¯w is trivial, or the normal subgroup it generates satisfies
hhw¯iiG >


w, t ¯ wt ¯
−1
, t2wt ¯
−2

≃ Cn ∗ Cn ∗ Cn > F2
where n ∈ {2, 3, . . .} ∪ {∞} is the order of ¯w. Again, Theorem 5 implies that ρ(G, S)
cannot be upper semi-computable, hence is transcendental.
In particular, we can take H defined by 10 generators and 27 relators [Col86], and
therefore G defined by as little as 11 generators and 27 relators.
