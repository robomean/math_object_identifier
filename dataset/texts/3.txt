BEST POLYNOMIAL APPROXIMATION FOR NON-AUTONOMOUS
LINEAR ODES IN THE ⋆-PRODUCT FRAMEWORK∗
STEFANO POZZA†
Abstract. We present the first formulation of the optimal polynomial approximation of the
solution of linear non-autonomous systems of ODEs in the framework of the so-called ⋆-product.
This product is the basis of new approaches for the solution of such ODEs, both in the analytical
and the numerical sense. The paper shows how to formally state the problem and derives upper
bounds for its error.

1. Introduction. Recently, a new approach has been introduced for the solution
of systems of linear non-autonomous ordinary differential equations based on the socalled ⋆-product [6, 7, 12, 16]. Such an approach has proved to be valuable and
effective analytically, by producing new explicit expressions for the solution of certain
problems [5, 6, 8], and numerically, being the basis of new efficient algorithms in
quantum chemistry problems [3, 13, 14, 15].
Given a Hermitian matrix-valued function A˜(t) ∈ C
N×N analytic on the bounded
interval I, and the nonzero vector ˜v ∈ C
N×N we consider the initial value problem
∂
∂tu˜(t) = A˜(t)˜u(t), u˜(a) = ˜v, t ∈ I = [a, b]. (1.1)
The ⋆-product is defined over a Fr´echet-Lie group on distributions [16]. In such a
group, the initial value problem becomes a ⋆-linear system. Thanks to this “linearization” of the ODE, new techniques can be applied to solve the problem. Here, we
focus on the polynomial approximation approach, which can be used both in numerical approaches and in the theoretical framework. In particular, in the latter one,
a symbolic algorithm named ⋆-Lanczos [8] is able to produce a Krylov-like subspace
approximation, that is, a polynomial approximation in the ⋆-product sense.
