Let's assume that $N$ is even if $N^2$ is odd.

In that case, we can write:
\[
N = 2K \quad \text{[our assumption]}
\]
where $K$ is a whole number.

Now that we have an equation to work with, letâ€™s begin to derive a contradiction:
\[
N = 2K \quad \text{[our assumption]}
\]
\[
N^2 = (2K)^2 \quad \text{[square both sides of the equation]}
\]
\[
N^2 = 4K^2
\]
\[
N^2 = 2(2K^2) \quad \text{[since } 4 = 2 \cdot 2 \text{]}
\]
From the equation in this last line, we can see that $N^2$ is even (since $K$ is an integer, $K^2$ is also an integer, as is $2K^2$ and 2 times an integer is an even number).
