Let's assume that N is even if N2 is odd.

In that case, we can write:

N = 2K  [our assumption]
where K is a whole number.

Now that we have an equation to work with, letâ€™s begin to derive a contradiction:

N = 2K  [our assumption]
N2 = (2K)2  [square both sides of the equation]
N2 = 4K2
N2 = 2(2K2)  [4 = 2*2]
From the equation in this last line, we can see that N2 is even (K is an integer, so K2 is also an integer, as is 2K2 and 2 times an integer is an even number).
