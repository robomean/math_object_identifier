\item A finite binary sequence of length $n$, which is the subject of analysis under the Lempel-Ziv Complexity measure, $C_{\text{LZ}}$.
\item Decomposed into a unique parsing of consecutive, non-overlapping blocks $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k$ in the computation of $C_{\text{LZ}}(s)$, where each block $s_i$ represents the shortest substring not found in the concatenation of the preceding blocks $s_1s_2\ldots s_{i-1}$, leading to the formal definition: \begin{equation} C_{\text{LZ}}(s) = \min \left{ k : s = s_1s_2\ldots s_k, \text{ and } \forall i, s_i \notin {s_1s_2\ldots s_{i-1}} \right}. \end{equation}
\item The sequence $s$ is utilized to evaluate the randomness and unpredictability of cryptographic keys through its Lempel-Ziv Complexity, with the complexity measure providing insights into the structural complexity and potential patterns within the sequence.
\item For a sequence $s$ generated by a random process, the expected Lempel-Ziv complexity is approximated by: \begin{equation} E[C_{\text{LZ}}(s)] \approx \frac{n}{\log_2(n)}, \end{equation} where deviations from this expected value can indicate non-randomness or regularities within the sequence $s$.
