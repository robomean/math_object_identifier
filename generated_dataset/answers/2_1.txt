\item Homoclinic tangle where the stable \( W^s(p) \) and unstable \( W^u(p) \) manifolds of a periodic orbit intersect.
\item Points in this intersection are homoclinic points \( q \) satisfying 
\[
q \in W^s(p) \cap W^u(p) \quad \text{and} \quad q \neq p.
\]
\item Indicates sensitive dependence on initial conditions, characteristic of chaotic systems.
\item Leads to complex dynamical behaviors and plays a crucial role in the creation of chaotic dynamics such as Smale's horseshoes.
\item Drives the system behavior into unpredictable and intricate dynamics due to the 'stretch and fold' mechanism inherent in chaotic systems.
