\item Quantum channel represented as a completely positive, trace-preserving (CPTP) map.
\item Described using Kraus operators representation: \(\Phi(\rho) = \sum_{k} A_k \rho A_k^\dagger\).
\item Completeness condition for Kraus operators: \(\sum_{k} A_k^\dagger A_k = I\).
\item Can be dilated to a unitary evolution on a larger Hilbert space including an environment.
\item Characterized by a Choi-Jamio≈Çkowski isomorphism which relates the channel to a density matrix \(J(\Phi)\).
\item Determines the ability to preserve or degrade quantum information.
\item Entanglement-breaking if all Kraus operators are of rank one, can degrade all entangled states into separable states.
\item Impact on quantum correlations, specifically regarding the preservation of entanglement in quantum states.
