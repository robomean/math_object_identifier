In the study of complex systems, the eigenvalue spectra of large random matrices play a pivotal role in statistical physics, quantum mechanics, and number theory. Specifically, consider the circular unitary ensemble (CUE), a class of random matrices characterized by unitary matrices whose eigenvalues lie on the unit circle in the complex plane. This ensemble is instrumental in modeling systems exhibiting symmetrical properties under unitary transformations.

For a given ( n \times n ) matrix ( U ) from the CUE, the joint probability density function (PDF) of its eigenvalues ({\lambda_i}) is given by: [ P(\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n) = \frac{1}{n!} \prod_{1 \leq j < k \leq n} |\lambda_k - \lambda_j|^2, ] reflecting that eigenvalues tend to repel each other, a fundamental property described as level repulsion in random matrix theory.
