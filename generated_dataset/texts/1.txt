In this section, we explore the construction and properties of quantum channels as completely positive, trace-preserving (CPTP) maps. Quantum channels are pivotal in the field of quantum information theory, providing a mathematical formalism for the evolution of quantum states in possibly noisy environments.

A quantum channel $\Phi$ can be described using the Kraus operators representation, where $\Phi(\rho) = \sum_{k} A_k \rho A_k^\dagger$ for a density matrix $\rho$. Here, ${A_k}$ are known as Kraus operators, and they satisfy the completeness condition $\sum_{k} A_k^\dagger A_k = I$, ensuring that $\Phi$ is trace-preserving.

Each quantum channel can be uniquely extended to a dilation to a unitary evolution on a larger Hilbert space, encapsulating the environment into which the quantum system may leak information. This is modeled by considering a unitary operator $U$ on the tensor product of the system's Hilbert space and an ancillary Hilbert space (representing the environment), and then tracing out the environment's degrees of freedom.

Moreover, the action of a quantum channel can be characterized by its ability to preserve or degrade quantum information. Specifically, the channel's capacity to convey quantum information is determined by its Choi-Jamio≈Çkowski isomorphism, which associates the channel with a density matrix $J(\Phi)$ in a larger space, constructed from the channel's action on part of an entangled state. This representation is critical for evaluating properties like entanglement breaking and for calculating the channel capacity using coherent information.

To further classify quantum channels, we consider their impact on quantum correlations. For instance, whether a channel is entanglement-breaking is determined by whether applying the channel (possibly concatenated with the identity channel) to any part of an entangled state results in a separable state. Entanglement-breaking channels have all Kraus operators being of rank one, thus simplifying their theoretical analysis and practical identification.
